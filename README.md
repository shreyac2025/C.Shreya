# AI Mood-Based Playlist Generator
An AI-powered app that generates Spotify playlists based on mood using Gemini AI.

## About This Project
I made a small app that helps you find music based on your mood. You just type how you're feeling—like "happy", "sad", or "chill"—and the app gives you Spotify playlists that match your vibe. It uses Gemini AI to understand your mood and shows playlists with links you can click to listen.

## How It Works
- You type your mood (like "workout" or "romantic")
- The app uses AI to figure out what kind of music fits that mood
- It shows you a list of Spotify playlists with names and links
- You can click the links and start listening right away
